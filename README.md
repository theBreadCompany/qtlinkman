# qtlinkman

A sample application using Qt.

## project

My goal was to create a simple app that can upload images to a server and maintain links to those. This goal should be achieved using C++ and Qt for GUI stuff. 

The reason for this is that I yet need to learn, especially C++ and C(ish) in general. This also means that this code, style etc. is far from perfect. I will improve this asap.

## yet TODO

- CLI version
- learn and use in another version that is yet to come
- change history table to history tree so collections actually make sense
- add subdomains
- add link redirects
- implement multifile upload
- add icon
- organize stuff

Please forgive me for again not pushing any files until I'm somewhat done.
